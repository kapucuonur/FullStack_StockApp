## Functions of the 'npm run build Command:

- Minification:
  The process of minimizing the code by removing unnecessary spaces, comments, and long variable names.
  JavaScript and CSS files are compressed to reduce the size of your code. This reduces page load times and improves overall performance.

- Optimizing Complex File Paths:
  File paths and names are optimized. Every part of your application is properly organized for faster loading and caching.

- Generating Static Files:
  Static files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media files are put together in the build folder. This folder contains the files that will be deployed for production.

- Compiling Application Code:
  JSX and modern JavaScript features are converted to standard JavaScript for wider browser compatibility.

- Efficiency and Performance Improvements:
  Webpack and other build tools perform various optimizations to make the code work more efficiently.

## JavaScript as an Interpreted Language

Transpiling: Languages ​​or extensions such as Modern JavaScript (ES6+), JSX, TypeScript are converted to older or standard JavaScript code. This is usually done by Babel or TypeScript compilers.

- Bundling: The process of combining code into a single file (or multiple files) instead of multiple files. This is done by tools such as Webpack or Rollup.

- Interpreted Language: JavaScript is traditionally considered an interpreted language because the code is executed line-by-line or statement-by-statement by the JavaScript engine in the browser or runtime environment. The JavaScript engine reads the code, interprets it, and executes it directly without the need for a separate compilation step.

- Dynamic Execution: JavaScript is executed dynamically at runtime, meaning that code can be modified and executed on the fly. This dynamic nature is a characteristic of interpreted languages.
